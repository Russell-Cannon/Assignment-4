# Notes
Libraries - Everything but STL algorithms
Works I-VI use open hashing (separate chaining)
Works VII-XII use linear probing
Read once, string-by-string
Display (and log) a list of words by their number of occurrences
    Display once, most to least
    Again, least to most
Clean words during input
    Capitalization doesn't matter
    keep single hyphens
    Discard double hyphens
Let the user search for words
    8 at a time (use '@@@' to mark queries that have less than 8 words)
Need to be able to display the number of sentences in the text
Report the time it takes for each task
All files need .h headers

# Questions
- [x] Is the due date supposed to be 4/25? 
- [ ] Do we combine works I-VI and VII-XII for the most occurring?
- [ ] Do we and how do we sort the word occurrences? Is there a specific algorithm in mind?
